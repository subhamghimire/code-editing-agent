# Code-Editing AI Agent

> Building a fully functional code-editing AI agent in less than 300 lines of Python

A simple yet powerful AI agent that can read, list, and edit files through natural conversation. Inspired by [Thorsten Ball's blog post](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) but implemented in Python for accessibility.

## 🎯 What This Does

This agent can:

- 📖 **Read files** - "What's in my agent.py?"
- 📋 **List directories** - "Show me all Python files in this project"
- ✏️ **Edit code** - "Add error handling to my function"
- 🔄 **Combine actions** - Intelligently chains tools to complete complex tasks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Setup (2 minutes)

1. **Clone and setup**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subhamghimire/code-editing-agent
cd code-editing-agent
pip install openai
```

2. **Set your API key**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

3. **Run it!**

```bash
python agent.py
```

## 💡 Try These Examples

### 🔍 File Reading

```
You: What's in my agent.py file?
GPT: I'll read that file for you...
```

### 📁 Directory Exploration

```
You: What files are in this project?
GPT: Let me list the files in your directory...
```

### 🛠️ Code Creation

```
You: Create a FizzBuzz program in JavaScript
GPT: I'll create a fizzbuzz.js file with a working FizzBuzz implementation...
```

### ✨ Code Editing

```
You: Add comments to my Python code and fix any bugs
GPT: I'll read your code, analyze it, and make improvements...
```

### 🧩 Complex Tasks

```
You: Create a ROT13 decoder that processes this string: 'Uryyb Jbeyq!'
GPT: I'll create a script that decodes ROT13 and processes your string...
```

## 🏗️ How It Works

The "magic" is surprisingly simple:

```
1. You type a message
2. Agent sends it to GPT + available tools
3. GPT decides which tools to use
4. Agent executes tools and sends results back
5. GPT gives you the final answer
6. Repeat!
```

### 🛠️ Available Tools

| Tool         | Description                       | Example Use                    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `read_file`  | Read any file's contents          | "Show me my config file"       |
| `list_files` | List directory contents           | "What Python files do I have?" |
| `edit_file`  | Edit files via string replacement | "Fix the bug in line 42"       |

## 🎨 What Makes This Special

- **🎯 Simple but Powerful** - Less than 300 lines, but handles complex tasks
- **🧠 Intelligent Tool Use** - GPT knows when and how to combine tools
- **💬 Natural Conversation** - No special commands, just talk naturally
- **🔧 Extensible** - Easy to add new tools and capabilities
- **🐍 Python Native** - Uses familiar Python patterns and libraries

## 🔧 Architecture

```python
# The core loop is surprisingly simple:
while True:
    user_input = get_user_message()
    response = gpt.chat(user_input, tools=available_tools)

    if response.wants_to_use_tool:
        result = execute_tool(response.tool_request)
        final_response = gpt.chat(result)

    print(final_response)
```

## 🚀 Extending the Agent

Want to add more capabilities? Here are some ideas:

### 🔧 System Tools

```python
# Run shell commands
def run_command(input_data):
    return subprocess.run(input_data['command'], capture_output=True, text=True)

# Search across files
def search_files(input_data):
    return grep_like_search(input_data['pattern'], input_data['directory'])
```

### 🌐 Web Tools

```python
# Fetch web content
def fetch_url(input_data):
    return requests.get(input_data['url']).text

# Search the web
def web_search(input_data):
    return search_api(input_data['query'])
```

### 📊 Data Tools

```python
# Analyze CSV files
def analyze_csv(input_data):
    return pandas.read_csv(input_data['file']).describe()

# Generate plots
def create_plot(input_data):
    return matplotlib_plot(input_data['data'])
```

## 🔮 The Big Picture

This project demonstrates a profound truth: **the most impressive AI capabilities often have surprisingly simple implementations**.

We're not just building a code editor - we're showing that:

- 🧠 **Intelligence can be emergent** from simple patterns
- 🔧 **Tools amplify AI capabilities** exponentially
- 🚀 **The future is accessible** to anyone willing to try
- 💡 **"Magic" is often just** good engineering

## 💭 A Final Thought

As I've shared this project with fellow engineers, many have been skeptical, waiting for the catch. But there isn't one. This is truly what it takes to build a code-editing agent - just 300 lines of Python and three simple tools.

While you could add more features like editor integration, better UI, or multi-agent support, the core magic lies in this simple implementation. The models are powerful enough that this basic setup can already do incredible things.

Try it yourself - I promise you'll be surprised by how far you can go with just these fundamentals. That's what makes this moment in AI so exciting - the barrier to entry is lower than you think.
